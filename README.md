# NFT Marketplace Web App on mumbai network with infura

This Project implements a mix of Web and Smart Contract Development.

The Idea was to build a web app on the mumbai tets network using @Dabit3's template and guide.
A few features were added:
-metamask connect button (with currentaccount view functionality)
-stylistic changes .
-a tutorials page
-a Footer
-ERC721 URItoken function conflicting with the state of the ERC721URItoken version of the same function due to override state. (this was changed)
-JSONRPC notation was depricated in web3js. A workaround using window.etherum was used in its place 





Techstack used:
-React.js
-Node.js
-Next.js
-tailwind.css
-Openzeppelin
-chai
-Infura JsonRpc
-css
-Hardhat
